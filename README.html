<h1>YARI -- Yet Another RISC Implementation</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>YARI is an high performance softcore RISC implementation, binary
compatible with a subset of MIPS R3000.</p>

YARI is still under active development, but the implementation
currently comprises:

<ul>
<li>
A reference simulator which can check the RTL implementation through
co-simulation.

</li><li>

A few regression and tests programs
</li><li>
An RTL (Verilog) implementation

  Core features:
    <ul><li>
    an eight stage pipeline.
    </li><li>
    a 4-way associative instruction cache (default 8 KiB)
    </li><li>
    a 4-way associative write-through data cache (default 16 KiB)
    </li><li>
    a store buffer
    </li><li>
    all of the integer user-level instructions supported (current
    missing DIV*).
    </li></ul>

  Peripherals (depending on the target)
    <ul><li>SRAM interface
    </li><li>640x480x1 video interface
    </li><li>Serial in/out
    </li></ul>

  Simulation
  <ul><li>
  Enough support to fully simulate the RTL with Icarus Verilog.
  </li><li>
  Co-simulation against the reference simulator supported
  </li></ul>

  Synthesis
  <ul><li>
  Targeted at the Altera Nios Dev Kit (Cyclone ed.), Cycore, and the LPRP, but more in future.
  </li><li>
  Runs at around 50+ MHz (soon 70+ MHz) in a EP1C20.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>A boot loader pre-loaded into the I$ - will load programs over the
  serial port.

  </li><li>Assorted tools to turn the elf binaries into ROM and RAM images.
</li></ul>




<h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>

There are a few prerequisites for full YARI enjoyment:

<ul><li>For building any test programs: Cross compilation tool much be built
  (mips-elf-gcc, etc).  The script xtools/BUILD is what I used to
  build them
</li><li>For simulation: Icarus Verilog.  Great stuff.  Get the most recent
  version from http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog

For synthesis: currently I've only tested with Quartus 7.2sp1.  Get it
for free from http://www.altera.com (alas, only works with Windows,
whereas everything else here expects Unix, Linux, or MacOSX).
</li></ul>

With the Icarus Verilog installed you should be able to simply run
<pre>
  make rtlsim
</pre>

and see the trace of instructions as the Verilog implementation makes
it through a small self-checking regression test. <p>

For more interesting workloads, try </p>

<pre>
  make -C testcases VERB= PROG=buzzard isasim
</pre>

or try co-simulation

<pre>
  make -C testcases VERB= PROG=fib cosim
</pre>
