Solving 2x2 go

This program solves the game of Go played on a 2x2 board using area
rules and positional superko. It demonstrates the enormous importance
of good move ordering in exhaustive alpha beta search. With the given
ordering of passing last, as many as 19397529 nodes are searched, up
to a depth of 58. But putting passes first requires the search of only
1446 nodes, to a depth of no more than 22. Minimax, which doesn't
depend on move ordering, takes over a week while searching a few
trillion nodes.
