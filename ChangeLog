    Don't kill the sim on div-by-zero and other changes

2007-09-22

    swsim: new option --disass-usercode
    load multiple elf files
    Simulator: Factored out the architectural MIPS state
    Initialize memory now matching endianess
    Speed stats.

	* swsim: more prepping for cp0 and cp1 support.

	* swsim: can load multiple elf files at once.

        * swsim: Factored out the architectural MIPS state. Preparing
          for more CP0 and CP1 support.

        * swsim: Rough speed statistics

          Numbers from one test run: ISA simulation is close to twice
          as fast as real time, which ISA/RTL cosimulation is about
          16,000 times slower. 4% of the instructions are JAL and it
          averaged 2.65 CPI.

    Be more explicit about unhandled instructions. Don't double load
    from IO space

2007-09-14

    Status update

2007-09-11

    Handle little-endian. Disassemble regs as $31 instead of r31, etc
    Prune unused code

2007-09-10

    Fixed a bad bug in the I$ interface. Now the "showtime" graphical
    demo loads with tinymon and executes correctly. Bring out the
    champagne.


2007-09-09

    The IO event counter is only 8-bit
    Easy control over verbosity
    Fix think-o in the simulated IO
    No timeouts on RTL simulations
    runmips was loading too many sections
    Minor build cleanup
    Minor cleanup
    Handle stalls directly
    Updated (and tested) the cross tool build script
    Emit the last 32 RTL traces upon divergence

2007-09-07

    Make ISA and RTL simulations match on IO behaviour

2007-09-06

    First feable ISA/RTL co-simulation running
    Dump all sections of ELF files

2007-09-04

    Changes needed for Mac OS X
    Make swsim not depend on system elf.h
    Silly re-indentation

2007-09-03

    Stupid bug in tinymon
    Verbosity killed the transfer. Silence is gold
    Updated .mif file for the quick hack
    Quick hack to see what's going on with my serial transmissions
    More small examples
    Example program changes

    Runmips knows about firmware simulation but still supports
    reformatting MIPS ELF files

    Tinymon more verbose about errors
    ISA simulation simulate uninitialized SRAM
    Firmware must initialize all data itself
    Better serial IO simulation in RTL
    _gp bugfix and Don't Drop Serial Input
    Much improved simulator tracing
    Stuff destined for read-only firmware needs to allocate data in
    SRAM

2007-09-02

    Cleaner clean
    Tinymon support readback
    Cleaner clean
    Deal more gracefully with DOS line conventions

2007-09-01

    Added emulated serial input to the RTL simulation and fixed a
    silly bug in tinymon.c

    Fixed a tricky bug in the cache line fetch

    Clearly my interconnect structure is too tricky for even me. I
    managed to use it incorrectly (Repeat after me: data is valid the
    cycle after strobe is set and wait is clear). This will all be
    replaced eventually.

    Fix indentation
    Add self-checking to Tinymon
    Debug message adjustment
    Null workload
    Remove a 4096 fudge factor - rationale lost in time
    Buglet fixed

2007-08-26

    Life is difficult without a writable text segment
    Broken checksums
    Make tinymon more tolerant
    ugh, are we dropping serial bytes?
    typo fix
    Even more feedback from tinymon
    More feedback from tinymon
    Add precompiled test case
    Promote tinymon to be the new default firmware.
    Fixed few minor issues.

    A functional tinymon and support in runmips to generate the
    format. Changes to runmips to support serial input from files.

    Update the serial interface (now 57600 bps)

2007-08-25

    Small fixes to the simulator, small fixes to testall.S

2007-08-23

    Fix a simulation problem and move toward a synchronous register file

    AFAICT, Icarus Verilog mistreats non-blocking assignments when mixed
    with blocking assignments, but the logic worked in Quartus II 7.1.
    Never the less, the rewritten Verilog is clearer and being able to
    test with Icarus is important.

    Minor changes:
    - Use the numeric registers when dissassembling.
    - A vain attempt to move towards a synchronous register file.
      Alas, it will take a significant rewrite to fix this. Punting on
      that as the whole pipeline will be replace "soon".

2007-08-22

    Fixed a compilation issue. *THIS* one sent to Martin

2007-08-22

    sent to Martin Schoeberl

2007-08-22

    Removed more junk

2007-08-21

    Cleaned up a bit

2007-08-21

    Onnama-2006 as it was left
    Development has resumed using GIT as the SCM.

0.19 2005-06-24
        - many moons later, started keeping Onnama under Hg which
          forces me to be more disciplined about what I write.
        - Check the README for the current state of affairs.

0.2 2004-01-30
        - signed/unsigned byte/short loads and stores implemented
        - first semi-public release

0.1 2004-01-28
        - Shifts were broken, but now Sieve works with bit strings!

0.0
        - Yeah, Sieve runs, spitting out primes on the serial port!
