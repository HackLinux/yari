This is a patch against newlib-1.15.0 available from RedHat:
http://sourceware.org/newlib/

As for now, yari does not support floating point operations as well as the
special lw{l,r}, sw{l,r} instructions. Therefore some additional configure
options are required for newlib to work correctly.

configure  <your options> --target=mips-elf --disable-newlib-io-float \
           --enable-target-optspace
