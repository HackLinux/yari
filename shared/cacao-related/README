This directory contains a set of packages required to build cacao (an open 
source java virtual machine) for yari. In addition to the files in this 
directory you will also need binutils and gcc. see the links below how to get 
the required packages. I use gcc version 4.1.1 and binutils 2.17, you may also 
use other version, but these are the ones used in the build script.

To build everything simply invoke:
./build.sh 

The build script has some options, use the following command to show them:
./build.sh -h

have fun,
florian
