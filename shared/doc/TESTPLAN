Self-checking test apps
  Directed tests (spectrum of manual and generated tests)

Cosimulation
  Real applications
  Random code

1. For self-checking tests needs a protocol to report results that
   works equally well for ISA simulation, RTL simulation, and FPGA
   execution.

2. Cosimulation is between ISA and RTL simulation. What is compared?
   pc, updated registers? A more general framework would run N
   instructions and compare state.

Focus initially on minimal effort, highest return approaches => auto
generated directed self-tests?
